  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>In my personal life I am working to become a better person with a more positive attitude. As to my professional life I am working towards becoming the most successful version of myself that I can be. There are many life experiences that I have gone through that had led me here. For example since I could remember I would always do things that could benefit me and be beneficial as when I was in the fifth grade I had a role of being a captain of the safety patrol not only that but I also helped out in the news crews which really made me feel that I was helping out although it wasn’t much I truly believe it really made a difference not only to help out the school but also for my self as it gave me a good reputation.  Now that I am older, I am working towards these goals by choosing classes that I know are going to benefit me in the future to give me a successful career not only that but also working hard to earn what I have. There are many values I consider most necessary for my success but the main one I believe in is in consistency because consistency is what leads me  to have strength and power in myself when I am struggling with something. A short term goal I hope to accomplish in the near future is to worry less. When I say this, I don’t mean to not care but to not over stress myself for small things. This will cause me to be least stress and to have a more positive outlook on life. Some character traits and achievements I most want to be known for is for always having a positive attitude and for being a hard worker for the things that I want for myself and for my future.</p>
